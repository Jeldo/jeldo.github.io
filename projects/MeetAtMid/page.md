About 85% of respondents say that they felt difficulty when making a decision for a meeting place. Of all of the respondents, over 65% usually discuss their meeting and only 17% of respondents use map applications. People who tend to follow other people's idea accounted for about 13% of the respondents.

There are various responses when asked about the time it takes to decide the location. This shows that a lot of people spend quite unnecessary time when making a decision.

Finally, when asked about their willingness to use our service, we found that 88% of the respondents were positive. Through these positive responses, we were able to start development with strong confidence in our service. ðŸ˜‰
